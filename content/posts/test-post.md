# New Blogging Setup

I wanted to alter my configuration to 

a. make it possible to blog from my iPad AND
b. host images on the VPS

This was written on the VPS with hugo installed and the images are served up on the same VPS with caddy.

Here's a test image, uploaded from the iPad with Secure Shellfish:
